# Configure alert and vulnerability notification rules

Alert and vulnerability rules can be configured by Administrator roles, such as Security Administrator.
Principle of least privileges must be followed, avoid using Global Admin where possible.

Path: Defender > Settings > Endpoints > Email Notifications


> Vulnerabilities notifications → for 0 days and acknowledged CVEs

* Low targets any CVSS score
* Medium 4.0 and above

Emails are then sent to the recipients whenever any of the specified settings are met.

Test: Let's launch our own VM in Azure. RDP into it then make sure it is onboarded in Defender for Endpoint.

Next, we want to download the EICAR anti-malware test file to help us generate some alerts in Defender.

If everything goes well Defender should trigger, let's verify this quickly with PowerShell `Get-MpThreatDetection`

code

And indeed going back to our alerts we see some traffic and we get notified.
